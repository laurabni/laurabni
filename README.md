# Hi and welcome on my profile ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I'm a co-op student in web development. 
I discovered web development through my studies and love to learn new technologies. I learn and practice in my studies but also in my free time.
The projects you can find on my profile are either from my studies or my personal projects.
